We live in an all-electric house. That means we only use electricity for cooking, air conditioning (heating, cooling), and hot water supply. Utilizing energy-efficient home appliances, and using an electricity rate plan that matches our lifestyle (not to mention having a solar panel), our energy bills are lower without compromising my family's safety and comfort.

## Energy-efficient home appliances

In Japan, [Eco-cute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EcoCute) and [IH cooking stove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking) are two common home appliances used in all-denka (オール<ruby><rb>電化</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>でんか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) house. In addition, we also use a [heat recovery ventilation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_recovery_ventilation). Initial investment costs for these appliances are high, but because they are energy efficient, the running costs should be low.

### IH cooking

> Induction cooking is often considered one of the most efficient cooking technologies. With this technology, up to 90% of the energy consumed is transferred to the food, compared to about 74% for traditional electric systems and 40% for gas.

[Research](https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf) shows induction cooktops are more energy-efficient than gas or electric. And it means not just environmental benefits but financial savings as well.

Because we were using gas before, we had to adapt to this new way of cooking. We were used to making adjustments to the amount of heat based on whether the fire is strong or weak. Now it is all electronically controlled in 10℃ increments with 10 levels starting from 140℃!

### Eco-Cute

> To produce 90°C hot water, an EcoCute consumes 66% less electricity than an electric water heater, and costs 80% less than heating water via natural gas in Japan.

Eco-Cute is a water heater using the same technology as heat pump air conditioners. Water is heated when the electricity rate is cheaper and then stored on a tank for later use. Storage tank capacity will depend on the number of users (family members) and how the hot water is going to be used.

### Heat recovery ventilation

> Mechanical Ventilation Heat Recovery extracts surrounding hot air and uses its thermal energy to warm up incoming fresh air....90% of the energy produced by the hot air extracted can be recovered, while renewing the air, and extracting pollutants and dust from the building.
> ...
> It comes with a summer bypass, which can be used as a cooling system at night.

Stiebel Eltron offers a selection of [energy-efficient ventilation systems](https://www.nihonstiebel.co.jp/products/air_conditioning/lineup/index/first_kind_lwz/#lwz). Mechanical ventilation uses a small amount of energy compared to the widely used non-electric japanese ventilation systems (manually opening windows...even in winter), but it is far more comfortable especially during cold winter nights.

Imagine the outside temperature in winter is 0℃. Without heat recovery, the incoming air from vents inside the house will be...0℃! (yeah, no surprise). With 90% heat recovery, however, incoming 0℃ air will become 18℃.

## Electricity Rate Plan

TEPCO offers various [rate plans](https://www.tepco.co.jp/ep/private/plan/index-j.html) for its customers, and we currently have the Denka-Jozu ([<ruby><rb>電化</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>でんか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>上手</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>じょうず</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>](https://www.tepco.co.jp/ep/private/plan2/old03.html)) plan. Denka-Jozu has different charge rates for three time zones ー `Day Hours`, `Morning and Evening Hours`, and `Night Hours`. The price for `Day Hours` differs for Summer (July 1 to September 30) and for other seasons (October 1 to June 30).

### Time Zone

| Time Zone                 | Details                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Day Hours                 | 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM                      |
| Morning and Evening Hours | 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM, 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM |
| Night Hours               | 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM                      |

### Charge Rate

| Category (per 1kWh)           |      Rate |
| ----------------------------- | --------: |
| Basic Charge (6kVA or less)   | ¥1,320.00 |
| Day Hours (Summer)            |    ¥39.44 |
| Day Hours (Other than summer) |    ¥32.32 |
| Morning and Evening Hours     |    ¥26.49 |
| Night Hours                   |    ¥12.48 |

The charge rate during `Night Hours` is less than half when compared to other time zones. Maximizing the usage of electricity at cheap time zones can significantly lower our electricity bills. And, as a reminder for myself, `Day Hours (Summer)` is **more than three times** the rate of `Night Hours`!

## Electricity Usage

Here is one example of our recent usage of electricity as recorded by the solar panel system. Red dot shows *consumption* (<ruby><rb>消費</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>しょうひ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) while green dot show *power generation* (<ruby><rb>発電</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>はつでん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>), x-axis is *time* while y-axis is *usage*.

![Electrity Usage Graph](/public/image/electricity-usage.png)

The graph shows there was a big usage at around 3:00 AM ー that was the heat pump water heater (Eco-Cute). Usage spikes at 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM? ー someone was working in the kitchen (IH Cooktops). How about that small persistent usage when the sun was down (flat green dots)? ー air conditioner (heat pump) running.

Ventilation, refrigerator, and other devices that work 24 Hours full time do not seem to be electricity hogs.

## Energy Bills

Energy bills before and after moving suggest that our total running costs became cheaper. My calculation shows around 320K yen of total savings for the last 5 years.

Of course, it is not the same house so not an apples-to-apples comparison. The solar panel also helps since we are not buying electricity during the day. On the other hand, the usage graph shows most of the electricity that the solar panel generates are sold (<ruby><rb>売電</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ばいでん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>).

## Safety and comfort

What is the point of all these energy efficiencies and financial savings when it will cost us safety and comfort?

We do not use fire inside the house, except for candles on birthday cakes. Not having gas cylinders chained to our house is another less thing to worry about.

Using just electricity does not necessarily translate to a comfortable house. But we do feel better not using a kerosene heater in winter. Moreover, heat recovery ventilation provides fresh air while preventing heat loss in winter. The same ventilation is responsible for removing moisture and odors from the bathroom/toilet/laundry room.

## Risk

Having a single source of energy is a risk. Japan being a disaster-prone country does not help either. And although power disruptions are rare in our place, it is not unheard of in Japan.

As long as power outages happen during the day, we can use the electricity generated by the solar panel. We do not have a storage battery system yet so I hope we do not experience long blackouts during winter nights. If that happens then we may have to use a few yutanpo ([<ruby><rb>湯</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ゆ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>たんぽ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/湯たんぽ)) to stay warm &#128560;.

## Summary

There are advantages and disadvantages when going all-electric. For us, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.

- Lower running cost offsets the high initial cost of purchasing home appliances.
- Efficient use of energy leads to lower electricity bills and therefore financial savings.
- An appropriate electricity rate plan allows us to take advantage of cheaper costs at night.
- High daytime electricity costs are covered by the solar panel.
- Less fire hazard by not using fire inside the house.
