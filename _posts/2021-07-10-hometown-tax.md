Many young people in Japan relocate from rural areas to bigger cities for education and employment opportunities. Because of the outflow of tax-paying residents, these rural areas eventually receive less tax revenue to finance public services. As part of the Japanese government's policy to revitalize local economies, the hometown tax program was introduced in 2008.

The hometown tax (ふるさと<ruby><rb>納税</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>のうぜい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) payment system is a mechanism for taxpayers in Japan (including foreign residents) to `donate` to any prefecture and municipality of their choice. Although the name includes "hometown", you can donate to any local government (prefectures, cities, towns, and villages) in Japan. Moreover, the "tax" here does not imply another financial burden to worry about, so relax.

According to a [2019 survey](https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000636996.pdf), the number of residents using the system to apply for a deduction has been increasing from about 33,000 in 2009 to about 3.95 million in 2019. Still, it is a small percentage of [employed persons](https://www.stat.go.jp/data/roudou/sokuhou/tsuki/pdf/gaiyou.pdf) in Japan which is about 66.56 million as of 2019.

Since it is treated as a donation, some of the amounts can be deducted from the income tax and resident tax. It is like your still paying tax to your local government, as you would normally do, but a portion of it is diverted to another local government that you wish to support. In other words, the donor basically pays the same amount of tax.

Many local governments also offer `thank you gifts` (お<ruby><rb>礼</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>れい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby><rb>品</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ひん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) to the donors. The selection of gifts is diverse and includes local produce, handicrafts, as well as tickets for different kinds of local events and attractions.

You may also indicate which policy areas you want your donations to be used, which include the following categories.

- education
- child support services
- regional and industrial recovery
- health, medical and welfare services
- tourism and exchange activities
- local environment
- sports and cultural activities

## How it works

First, you need to decide which local governing body you wish to receive your donation. This will be a personal choice. It may be because you have lived and taken care of in a certain municipality. Or you want to help a place devasted by a recent calamity. Or perhaps you wish to try and taste a local produce.

Next, you need a way to send your donation. The exact procedures on how to make the donation and how to receive the gifts vary depending on the local government. Some prefectures and municipalities put the information on their official websites.

Finally, you need to deal with the tax deduction. If you want to avail of the tax deduction, your local government must know about the donation to be able to compute your final local tax.

It sounds complicated but the procedure can be as simple as ordering from an e-commerce site (literally), and then sending a specific (almost pre-filled) form by mail to have your tax deduction dealt with.

## Hometown Tax Processing Websites

Accessing multiple Japanese government websites having different user interfaces and procedures would be troublesome. Fortunately, there are specific websites that you can use to search and make payments. Not any of them supports all the local governments in Japan, but Furusato Choice (ふるさとチョイス) seems to be the most popular. Furusato Choice is also what I personally use.

- [ふるさとチョイス](https://www.furusato-tax.jp/)
- [さとふる](https://www.satofull.jp)
- [ふるなび](https://furunavi.jp)
- [ANAのふるさと納税](https://furusato.ana.co.jp)
- [Rakuten](https://event.rakuten.co.jp/furusato/)

Please note that currently none of the sites above has an English interface. **Furumaru** was the only site that you can navigate in English, but it no longer works as of March 31, 2020.

## Tax Deduction

You need to file a tax return to receive a tax deduction. Currently, there are two options: using the **One-stop Exemption System** and through **Income Tax Return**.

### One-stop Exemption System

This is the easier of the two. All you have to do is fill out an application form, attach the necessary documents, and send it to the local government where you have donated. The total amount of deductions will be automatically reflected in your resident tax the following year.

So, what's the catch? You have to meet all the following conditions to become eligible for this option.

- Being a salaried employee who does not need to file for a final income tax return. This is the case where the company files on behalf of the employee.
- Donated to five or less different local governments within a single calendar year. Multiple donations to the same local government are counted as one.

You need to send the application form every time you made a donation. Multiple donations to the same local government need multiple submissions of the application form.

### Income Tax Return

You need to file an income tax return if you are not eligible for the one-stop exemption system. For example, if any of the following applies to you then this is your only option.

- Your annual income is more than 20 million yen.
- You are applying for a home loan tax deduction for the first year.
- You have donated to more than five different local governments within a single calendar year.

## One-stop Application Form

The one-stop application form usually arrives before the gift item and many information are already been pre-filled for you. The form should also come with an example of how to fill in the remaining information and how to attach the necessary documents.

In addition to writing your "My number" (<ruby><rb>個人</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>こじん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>番号</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ばんごう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) in the application form, you also need to prove that it is yours. You need to attach a copy of <ruby><rb>個人</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>こじん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>番号</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ばんごう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>カード if you have one, or a copy of <ruby><rb>個人</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>こじん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>番号</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>ばんごう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby><rb>通知</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>つうち</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>カード plus a copy of another identity document (drivers license, etc). Most municipalities will include a separate form where you can paste these identity verification documents, as well as a return envelope.

## FAQ

**What is the maximum amount of annual donation which can be deducted from local tax?**  

It depends on many variables like your annual income, the amount of other tax deductions you are receiving, your family structure, etc. Furusato Choice has a [page dedicated](https://www.furusato-tax.jp/about/simulation) to estimating this amount.

**How do I know if my one-stop application is accepted?**  

You should receive a confirmation (by post or email) from the local government who received your donation that they received the one-stop application form and that they were able to process it without a problem.

**How do I know if my donation is actually deducted from my local tax?**  

The resident tax notice (<ruby><rb>住民税</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>じゅうみんぜい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby><rb>納税通知書</rb><rp>(</rp><rt>のうぜいつうちしょ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) that usually arrive around June of the following year will show you. It should look like the following (red font to emphasize).
